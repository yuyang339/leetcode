https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-profit-in-job-scheduling/

# Problem
We have n jobs, where every job is scheduled to be done from startTime[i] to endTime[i], obtaining a profit of profit[i].

You're given the startTime , endTime and profit arrays, you need to output the maximum profit you can take such that there are no 2 jobs in the subset with overlapping time range.

If you choose a job that ends at time X you will be able to start another job that starts at time X.

# Example
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first and fourth job. 
Time range [1-3]+[3-6] , we get profit of 120 = 50 + 70.

Input: startTime = [1,2,3,4,6], endTime = [3,5,10,6,9], profit = [20,20,100,70,60]
Output: 150
Explanation: The subset chosen is the first, fourth and fifth job. 
Profit obtained 150 = 20 + 70 + 60.

Input: startTime = [1,1,1], endTime = [2,3,4], profit = [5,6,4]
Output: 6

# Solution
The brutal force solution is we try all the valid job combinations.
For each combination, we calculate the profit.
There are a lot of redundency in this solution.
A lot of combinations are calculated again and again.

The optimal solution is to use dynamic progarmming.
The idea is we calculate the subproblems and find the state transition function between the problem and its subproblems.
Let dp[i] represent the the max total profit if we schedule job i.
Then The state transition function is
dp[i] = max(dp[j]+profit, dp[i-1]) where j represents the latest job that is not overlapped with job i. dp[i-1] represents the max total profit
if we do not schedule job i
For this problem
# Complexity
O(NlogN)

# Code

```c++
int jobScheduling(vector<int>& startTime, vector<int>& endTime, vector<int>& profit) {
        int n = startTime.size();
        vector<vector<int>> jobs(n, vector<int>(3));
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i){
            jobs[i] = {{startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i]}};
        }
        sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), [](auto& a, auto& b){return a[1] < b[1];});
        map<int, int> dp{{0, 0}};
        for(auto& job : jobs){
            // dp[j]
            auto it = prev(dp.upper_bound(job[0]));
            // dp[i-1]
            auto profit_not_schedule_i = dp.rbegin()->second;
            // dp[i] = max(dp[j]+profit, dp[i-1])
            dp[job[1]] = max(profit_not_schedule_i, it->second+job[2]);
            if (res < dp[job[1]])
                res = dp[job[1]];
        }
        return res;
    }
```

```python
def jobScheduling(self, startTime, endTime, profit):
    jobs = sorted(zip(startTime, endTime, profit), key=lambda v: v[1])
    dp = [[0, 0]] # [[end, profit]]
    for s, e, p in jobs:
        i = bisect.bisect(dp, [s + 1]) - 1
        if dp[i][1] + p > dp[-1][1]:
            dp.append([e, dp[i][1] + p])
    return dp[-1][1]
