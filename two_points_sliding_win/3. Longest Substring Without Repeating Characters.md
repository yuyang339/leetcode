# Problem
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

# Example

Example 1:

Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 

Example 2:

Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


# Solution
The brutal force solution is we try all the substrings and find the one with longest non-repeating characters.
the time complexity is O(N^3)
The optimal solution is to define two pointers, start pointer and end pointer which point to the start and end of a substring. 
We use hashmap to store the character and its position.
We move the end pointer forward by 1 if the character pointed by the end pointer is unique within the window.
If the character is not unique, then we need to figure out where we see this character last time. This is easy. 
We just need to use hashmap[s[end pointer]] to get the position which is the last time we see this character.
The new start pointer needs to be updated according to hashmap[s[end pointer]].
Now the trick part is hashmap[s[end pointer]] may not be able to update start pointer directly. 
The reason is that we store all the characters in the hashmap, not just the characters between the start pointer and end pointer.
It is possible that hashmap[s[end pointer]] give us some position that is not in between start pointer and end pointer.
So we need to check whether start pointer is greater than hashmap[s[end pointer]]. if yes, then do not update start pointer.

```c++
int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_map<int, int> um;
        if(s.size() <= 1) return s.size();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int n = s.size();
        int res = 0;
        while(i <= j && j < n){
            if(um.count(s[j]) != 0){
                // this is the tricky part. 
                i = max(i, um[s[j]]+1);
                res = max(res, j-i+1);
                um[s[j]] = j;
                j += 1;
            }
            else{
                res = max(res, j-i+1);
                um[s[j]] = j;
                j += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
        
    }
```

```python
if not s: return 0
        d = collections.defaultdict(int)
        start = 0
        end = 0
        maxlen = 0
        while start <= end and end < len(s):
            if s[end] not in d:
                d[s[end]] = end
                maxlen = max(maxlen, end-start+1)
                end += 1
            else:
                start = max(start, d[s[end]] + 1)
                maxlen = max(maxlen, end-start+1)
                d[s[end]] = end
                end += 1
        return maxlen

```
