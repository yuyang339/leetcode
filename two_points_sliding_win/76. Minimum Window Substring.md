# Problem
Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

# Example
Example:

Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"

Note:

    If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "".
    If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.


# Solution
This solution is similiar to the 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words
They both need a hashmap to check whether a substring meets the requirement.
The difference is we first expand the slide window until we find a substring contains T.
Then we shrink the slide window until the substring doesn't contain T.

# Complexity
O(N)

# Code

```c++
string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> m;
        // Statistic for count of char in t
        for (auto c : t) m[c]++;
        // counter represents the number of chars of t to be found in s.
        size_t start = 0, end = 0, counter = t.size(), minStart = 0, minLen = INT_MAX;
        size_t size = s.size();

        // Move end to find a valid window.
        while (end < size) {
            // If char in s exists in t, decrease counter
            if (m[s[end]] > 0)
                counter--;
            // Decrease m[s[end]]. If char does not exist in t, m[s[end]] will be negative.
            if(m.find(s[end]) != m.end()) m[s[end]]--;
            end++;
            // When we found a valid window, move start to find smaller window.
            while (counter == 0) {
                if (end - start < minLen) {
                    minStart = start;
                    minLen = end - start;
                }
                if(m.find(s[start]) != m.end()) m[s[start]]++;
                // When char exists in t, increase counter.
                if (m[s[start]] > 0)
                    counter++;
                start++;
            }
        }
        if (minLen != INT_MAX)
            return s.substr(minStart, minLen);
        return "";
