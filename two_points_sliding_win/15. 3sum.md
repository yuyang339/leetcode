# Problem
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

Note:

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

# Example
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]

# Solution
a + b + c = 0 => a + b = -c

This is similiar to 2sum problem.

We need to find two numbers a and b in the array, such that a + b = -c where -c is another number in the array.

Let us use the first element as target value, i.e. c = nums[0]. 

then we go through all the rest of numbers to see if the sum is equal to -c.

To make the search more effecitve, we do two things. firstly, we sort the array. secondly we use two pointers, start and 

end. start points to the beginning of the array.

end pointer points to the end of the array. 

if the sum is bigger than -c, then end pointer--. 

if the sum is smaller than -c, then start poiner++.

```python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        n = len(nums)
        res = []
        for i in range(n):
            target = nums[i]*-1
            if i>0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue
            start = i + 1
            end = n-1         
            while start < end:
                if target == nums[start] + nums[end]:
                    res.append([nums[i], nums[start], nums[end]])
                    while start < end and nums[start] == nums[start+1]:
                        start += 1
                    while start < end and nums[end] == nums[end-1]:
                        end -= 1
                    start += 1 
                    end -= 1
                elif target < nums[start] + nums[end]:
                    end -= 1
                else:
                    start += 1
        return res
